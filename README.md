# Instabot-using-Pythion
We will use a third party module called instapy in this project

We will need mozilla firefox browser for this project as this project needs the use of selenium and google chrome is no longer supporting selenium.

This project wont get you 1000 followers in 10 minutes or anything like that , but it can help you to automate the follow, like or comment activity in your instagram account.

Instapy is a really great module where you can automate everything your instagram account need to grow.

First run index module successfully and then go for index1.

Use of pycharm IDE is recommended.
